	json-dbus-bridge is a fast-cgi application that provides access to D-Bus.
	It accepts JSON-RPC[1] calls as used by qooxdoo[2] and translates these
	into D-Bus calls. Any response is converted back to JSON and sent to the
	client.
	The bridge is completely generic. New D-Bus services can be added without
	modifications to the bridge.
