	Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.  
        We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. 
        Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across 
        a broad spectrum of applications. The Boost license encourages 
        both commercial and non-commercial use.
