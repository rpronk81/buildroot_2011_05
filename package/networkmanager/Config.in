	  The point of NetworkManager is to make networking configuration and
	  setup as painless and automatic as possible. If using DHCP,
	  NetworkManager is intended to replace default routes, obtain IP
	  addresses from a DHCP server and change nameservers whenever it 
	  sees fit. In effect, the goal of NetworkManager is to make 
	  networking Just Work.
