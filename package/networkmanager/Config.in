	The point of NetworkManager is to make networking configuration and
	setup as painless and automatic as possible. If using DHCP,
	NetworkManager is intended to replace default routes, obtain IP
	addresses from a DHCP server and change nameservers whenever it sees
	fit. In effect, the goal of NetworkManager is to make networking Just Work.
